		<div class="heading">Teamwork</div>
		<div class="text">I look at myself as a great teamplayer. I am able to follow the tasks given to me and assist others when needed. 
			I lack experience as a team leader but am up for a challenge.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="main-heading">Technology</div>
	<div class="section">
		<div class="heading">HTML/CSS/JS</div>
		<div class="text">I have lots of experience with Javascript as a scripting tool in the form of browser extensions. 
			HTML & CSS are hard to master but I find that I have gotten a lot better using them over the years. 
			I am able to more efficiently create and use classes, flexboxes and properly structured and named sections to group elements. 
			<br><br>
			Most of my experience has been on the front-end and simplistic back-end. When it comes to Javascript I have heard of but don't yet have experience 
			with systems like Typescript.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<div class="heading">Linux</div>
		<div class="text">I do not use Linux as my daily driver but I have my own server where I host websites, discord bots, etc. 
			I feel familiar with simple commands like <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>nano</code>, <code>ssh</code>, etc. 
			<br><br>
			I have not used Linux for too long and I often have to look up commands but even then I have been able to get my websites running 
			using Nginx, setting up databases, running small Java programs, etc. 
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<div class="heading">Back-end (Node.js)</div>
		<div class="text">I have built all my back-end apps using Node.js (express). As Javascript is my strongest language then I find it easy and logical to use it for the server-side code too. 
			I have experience with packages like <code>passport</code>, <code>mongoose</code>, <code>body-parser</code>, <code>flash</code>, etc.
			<br><br>
			My main database has been MongoDB and the main templating language EJS. 
			I don't yet have that much experience with large-scale websites/applications and frameworks like React, Vue, Angular. 
			Most of my own buils have been simple few-page-websites or one-file-bots.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<div class="heading">Python</div>
		<div class="text">
			Python was the first language I learned and I have taken multiple courses on it including a quite intensive course in University.
			Though I do not consider Python as my strongest side I feel comfortable with it and am ready to learn new libraries.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<div class="heading">Android Studio</div>
		<div class="text">
			I have looked into courses about Android Studio on Udemy.com and also done some dabbling on my own including reading and writing onto NFC chips.
			But I haven't finished any real projects so my experience ends with that. 
			Although I feel like if I get myself back on the wave then I can take Android Studio and/or Java up again.

	<div class="main-heading">Other</div>
	<div class="section">
		<div class="heading">Debating</div>
		<div class="text">Even though I don't have much experience in official debating, I do think I am a good debater in everyday life. 
			I enjoy sharing and reasoning my opinions and views.
